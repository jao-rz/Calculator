TO FIX:
-Percent is not working
-Percent can only be typed at the end of a number. 
-If the number has a percent at the end, 
no other nubers can be typed on that element

TO DO:
-change backspaceButton from 'E' to a backspace symbol.
-Make all the buttons work properly.
    -percentButton:
        -if number has percentage, 
        divide the number by 100
    -operateButton:
        -
    -Display a snarky error message if 
    the user tries to divide by 
    0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!

    -You should round answers with long decimals so that 
    they don’t overflow the screen.

    -Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an 
    operator could cause problems!

    -Add keybord support

    -Make the calculator look nicer
