-start by creating functions for the following items:
    -add
    -subtract
    -multiply

2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

-Create calculator design.
    -Display
    -Clear buttons
    -Equals key
    -arithmetic operator icons
    -numbers

-Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… 
you should be storing the ‘display value’ 
in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.

-Make all the buttons work properly.
