-Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… 
you should be storing the ‘display value’ 
in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.

-When a button is clicked on,
separate expression into expressionParts.
    If clicked button is an operator,
    and the last character in the expressionParts array is an operator,
    change the last element in the expressionParts array into the clicked one,
    join the expressionParts and put it in the expression variable.
    Then update the display text with the new expression. 

    else ,
    append the clicked text to the display string.    


-When the negative sign is clicked,
if the last character on the display string is a positive number,
turn it to negative.


-Make all the buttons work properly.
