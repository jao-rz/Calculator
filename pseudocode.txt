TO FIX:
-if user clicks on operateButton and 
there's only one number on display then 
the number disappears.
-Can calculate float numbers, but 
doesn't always return a float number when
it should. (Ex. '5.371980182302326e+22 x 5' returns '25'; it 
ignores everything after the decimal period);

TO DO:
-Create operate function in code pen
-Add operate function to script
-change backspaceButton from 'E' to a backspace symbol.
-Make all the buttons work properly.
    -percentButton:
        -if number has percentage, 
        divide the number by 100
    -operateButton:
        -
    -Display a snarky error message if 
    the user tries to divide by 
    0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!

    -You should round answers with long decimals so that 
    they don’t overflow the screen.

    -Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an 
    operator could cause problems!

    -Add keybord support

    -Make the calculator look nicer
